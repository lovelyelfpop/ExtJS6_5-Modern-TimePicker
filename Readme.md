Since Sencha ExtJS 6.5 Modern didn't provide a timepickerfield/timefield, so I wrote one.

## Download the Ext JS Framework

If you have not already done so, download and unpack the Ext JS framework from either the Products section 
of the main Sencha website [sencha.com](www.sencha.com) or from the downloads section of the Sencha Support portal. 

## Add Framework to your App

Once you have your application where you want it, "cd" into its directory in your Command Line Interface (CLI).  Then, 
issue the following command:

	sencha app install --framework=/path/to/extjs/

This command will wrap your app code folder with a Sencha Cmd framework that allows your application to benefit 
from Cmd's many features.

## Launch The Application

Run this command so that Cmd will generate a web server for you:

	sencha app watch

You can now visit the resulting address displayed in your console.  It will usually be found here:

  	http://localhost:1841
